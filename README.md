# SharedQueue
A simple library that implements a thread safe queue for multiple consumers and multiple producers.  

To run the project use following steps
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

This will setup the project. Now let's build the executable as following
```
make 
```

Now run the executable. 
```
./sharedQueue
```

That's it. In future changes I will be adding testing and logging using some public libraries
for exmple spdlog and Catch2 for unit testing.
